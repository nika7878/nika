    <p>
        I don't want a lot for Christmas
        There is just one thing I need
        I don't care about the presents
        Underneath the Christmas tree
        I just want you for my own
        More than you could ever know
        Make my wish come true
        All I want for Christmas is you, yeah
    </p>

    <br>

    <pre>
    I don't want a lot for Christmas
    There is just one thing I need (And I)
    Don't care about the presents
    Underneath the Christmas tree
    I don't need to hang my stocking
    There upon the fireplace (Ah)
    Santa Claus won't make me happy
    With a toy on Christmas Day
    </pre>

    <br>

    <pre>
    I just want you for my own (Ooh)
    More than you could ever know (Ooh)
    Make my wish come true
    All I want for Christmas is you
    You, baby
    </pre>

    <br>

    <pre>
    Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas
    I won't even wish for snow (And I)
    I'm just gonna keep on waiting
    Underneath the mistletoe
    I won't make a list and send it
    To the North Pole for Saint Nick (Ah)
    I won't even stay awake to
    Hear those magic reindeer click
    </pre>
    
    <br>

    <pre>
    'Cause I just want you here tonight (Ooh)
    Holding on to me so tight (Ooh)
    What more can I do?
    Oh baby, all I want for Christmas is you
    You, baby
    </pre>
    
    <br>

    <pre>
    Oh, all the lights are shining
    So brightly everywhere (So brightly, baby)
    And the sound of children's
    Laughter fills the air (Oh, oh yeah)
    And everyone is singing (Oh yeah)
    I hear those sleigh bells ringing (Oh)
    Santa, won't you bring me the one I really need? (Yeah, oh, oh)
    Won't you please bring my baby to me?
    </pre>
    
    <br>

    <pre>
    Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
    This is all I'm asking for (Ah)
    I just wanna see my baby
    Standing right outside my door
    </pre>
    
    <br>

    <pre>
    Oh, I just want you for my own (Ooh)
    More than you could ever know (Ooh)
    Make my wish come true
    Oh baby, all I want for Christmas is you
    </pre>
    
    <br>

    <pre>
    You, baby
    All I want for Christmas is you, baby (You)
    All I want for Christmas is you, baby (Ah, oh, ah, oh)
    All I want for Christmas is you, baby (You)
    All I want for Christmas is you, baby (All I really want, baby, ooh)
    All I want for Christmas is you, baby (All I want, all I really want is you)
